        "Coding": "Students learn the fundamentals of the true language of the 21st century – coding.  Following an introduction to programming and its core concepts, they learn to code via hands-on projects in robotics, video games, and web and app design. Students are exposed to a variety of programming languages, including Python, Ruby on Rails, and C++, and choose one language to focus on for a final project. Students visit university computer science laboratories and local tech start-ups. Lab fee of $100 US per session.",
        "Cosmology": "How did the universe come into being, and how will it end? What is the universe made of? What is space, and what is time? Cosmology takes as its subject nothing less than the entirety of the universe – its evolution, origin, and structure. Students examine the development of galaxies, the shining of stars, and the Big Bang theory. They also venture into the unresolved mysteries of space, including black holes and dark matter. Cambridge has hosted an unbroken chain of cosmologists from Isaac Newton to Stephen Hawking. Where better to gain a foundation in this fascinating subject? ",
        "Creative Writing": "Students compose fiction and poetry under the guidance of a published writer, with Cambridge’s rich literary history as their inspiration. They explore their own potential by experimenting with new forms and styles of writing. Successful poets and writers give workshops in which students learn about the creative process and the practicalities of publication. Students develop a portfolio of their best writing and collaborate to design, edit, and publish a literary magazine. ",
        "Criminology": "Through workshops, debates, and visits to police stations and criminal courts, students explore individual and social theories of crime, philosophies of punishment, criminal profiling, incident analysis, and basic forensic science. They consider the causes of crime, the influence of the media upon crime, and issues of race and gender within the context of the British and American criminal justice systems. ",
        "Engineering": "Students learn the principles of engineering science. Both world-renowned and local examples are examined, and the findings are applied to a variety of case studies to solve mechanical, structural, and architectural problems. They complete the course by designing a model engineering project of their own. ",
        "Entrepreneurialism": "Students discover what makes and drives entrepreneurs, what rules they should follow, and which ones to defy. They learn how to identify demand, generate a business plan, canvas for support, calculate overhead, determine fixed and marginal cost, estimate break-even and future value, and manage debts and depreciation. They identify a gap or need in the market and produce their own business and marketing plans before launching pop-up businesses. ",
        "Espionage": "At the University from which the Cambridge Five were recruited, and in which the world’s most famous fictional spy, James Bond, studied, this course, which blends politics and history with practice, examines the methods and techniques of the great intelligence services – Mossad, the KGB, the CIA, MI5, and MI6. Students address the future of intelligence operations, the challenges of field work, and the ethics of espionage in terms of international cooperation, competition, and conflict. ",
        "Filmmaking": "With instruction from professionals, students work in small groups to brainstorm, conceive, write, and produce short films (fiction, non-fiction, documentary, or experimental), which they shoot with digital video cameras and edit with professional software.

Course projects include real-life case studies and the design of a start-up venture. ",
	"Global Politics": "This fusion of international relations, law, political science, and war studies challenges students to understand the order and disorder of the modern world. Technological connectivity and the spread of democracy has streamlined and strengthened global culture. But the rise of rogue states and the clash of civilizations in the Middle East has presented more challenges to the unity of nations than ever before. The Major course builds toward a Model UN. ",
        "Law": "Students discover how the British and American legal systems reflect the values and institutions of their respective societies. They consider precedent-setting cases and delve into various branches of legal practice. Through meetings with lawyers, legal scholars, and human rights advocates, and through visits to working courtrooms, they discover how lawyers turn theory into practice. The Major course culminates in a formal moot court competition. ",
        "Medical Science": "This hands-on course introduces students to key aspects of medical science and modern medical practice. Combining specialist lectures with experiments and class discussions, students learn the principles of human anatomy and physiology, the pathology and significance of certain diseases, the main challenges that medical science faces today, and are introduced to the wide and growing range of possible careers in medicine. ",
        "Molecular Biology": "After reviewing molecular structure, cell biology, and the function and operation of genes and proteins, students analyze the factors underlying diseases and explore topics such as genetic engineering, cloning, and gene therapy.

At the same time they discover how society adapted to change, with the emergence of universal education, parliamentarianism, and massconsumerism. As a final project, students debate the future in the wake of new nationalisms, rivalries, and protectionisms. ",
